Highly migratory species, Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (Ref. 26139).  Mt DNA restriction analysis reveal that genetic differentiation occurs between populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and the tropical Atlantic ocean, indicating little genetic exchange occurring between the two (Ref. 12784).

It is unclear whether there are two separate stocks or a single population in the Atlantic.  Highly migratory species, Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (Ref. 26139).

Entered Mediterranean Sea from Red sea via Suez Canal.  Highly migratory species, Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (Ref. 26139).  Some authors recognize a single worldwide species, Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw & Nodder 1792) but we follow Nakamura 1990 (Ref. 10820) retaining the usage of Istiophorus platypterus for the Indo-Pacific sailfish and Istiophorus albicans for the Atlantic sailfish in recognition of the differences between them.

We follow Nakamura 1985 (Ref. 43) in recognizing Makaira mazara and Makaira nigricans as two distinct species chiefly because of differences in the pattern of the lateral line system.  Many scientists, however, do not recognize this character as specifically diagnostic and consider the latter species as a single pantropical species occurring in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.
